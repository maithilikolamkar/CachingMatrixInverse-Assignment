# CachingMatrixInverse-Assignment
##Program to cache inverse of matix(calculated using solve) and retrieve cached values rather than recomputing


## Function name: makeCacheMatrix
## This function creates a list containing functions to perform following actions:
## 1) Set the value of the matrix
## 2) Get the value of the matrix
## 3) Set inverse of the matrix
## 4) Get inverse of the matrix


## Function name: cacheSolve
## This function calculates the inverse of the matrix if it is not already computed and saves it in cache
## Else it returns the mean from the cache
